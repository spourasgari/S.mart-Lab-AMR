# Sensor Fusion with robot_localization

[Link to the original repository](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization)

The fusion of wheel odometry and laser scan matcher is relatively good (the delays and power issues still make problems). Fusing IMU has been initiated, but needs more work. A potential problem might be in the data published on IMU topic. Refer to the camera's README.md file in Intel RealSense directory for more information.
